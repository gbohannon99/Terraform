# Terraform S3 Bucket and CloudFront Configuration

## Overview

This Terraform project automates the provisioning of an Amazon S3 bucket and a CloudFront distribution. The S3 bucket serves as a storage solution for static content, while the CloudFront distribution acts as a content delivery network for fast and reliable access to the stored content.

## Project Steps

1. **Create an S3 Bucket**: This project starts by creating an S3 bucket. Terraform handles essential configurations such as the bucket name, region, and access control settings.

2. **Create a CloudFront Distribution**: Next, a CloudFront distribution is created to serve the content stored in the S3 bucket. Terraform manages key parameters like the origin, cache behavior, and distribution settings.

3. **Configure S3 and CloudFront**: Once both the S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution are in place, they need to be configured to work seamlessly together. Terraform provisions resources like origin access identity and bucket policies to establish this connection.

4. **Deployment**: The Terraform configuration is deployed to execute the provisioning process for the S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution.

## Benefits

- **Automation**: Save time and effort by automating the provisioning of AWS resources.
  
- **Version Control**: Keep your infrastructure as code (IaC) version-controlled and easily share it with your team for collaboration.

- **Consistency**: Ensure consistency in your infrastructure setup and minimize the risk of errors or misconfigurations.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Modify the Terraform configuration files according to your project requirements.
3. Run `terraform init` to initialize your Terraform environment.
4. Run `terraform apply` to provision the S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution.

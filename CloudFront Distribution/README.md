Project Description:

This project aims to create a Terraform configuration that provisions an S3 bucket and a CloudFront distribution for serving the content of the S3 bucket we create. The S3 bucket will be used to store content, and the CloudFront distribution will be used as a content delivery network for fast and reliable access to that content.

The project will require the following steps:

Create an S3 bucket: The first step is to create an S3 bucket that will store the static content. The Terraform configuration will include the necessary resources for creating an S3 bucket, such as bucket name, region, and access control settings.

Create a CloudFront distribution: The next step is to create a CloudFront distribution that will serve the content of the S3 bucket. The Terraform configuration will include the necessary resources for creating a CloudFront distribution, such as origin, cache behavior, and distribution settings.

Configure the S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution: Once the S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution are created, the next step is to configure them to work together. The Terraform configuration will include the necessary resources for configuring the S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution, such as origin access identity and bucket policy.

Deploy the configuration: Finally, the Terraform configuration will be deployed to provision the S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution.

This project is useful for developers who want to automate the provisioning of an S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution, which can save time and effort. The Terraform configuration can be version-controlled and shared with other team members, making it easy to collaborate on the project. Additionally, using Terraform for provisioning and configuration management ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors or misconfigurations.
